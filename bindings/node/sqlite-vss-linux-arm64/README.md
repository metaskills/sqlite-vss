# sqlite-vss-linux-arm64

A `sqlite-vss` platform-specific package for `linux-arm64`. 

When `sqlite-vss` is installed and the host computer has a `linux` operating system with `arm64` architecture, then this package is downloaded with the pre-compiled SQLite extension bundled under `lib/vss0.so`. At runtime, the `sqlite-vss` package will resolve to this platform-specific package for use with [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)' or [`node-sqlite3`](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3).

See the `sqlite-vss` package for more details.
